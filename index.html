                <br>

                <p>
                  On October 6th, 2019, at the 6th Annual Bučijada Haiku Meeting in Ivanić-Grad, Croatia, it was our
                  pleasure to present six haiku and one senryu, each of which was composed co-operatively and equally by
                  all three of us.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                  During a one year span we composed a total of 85 haiku and senryu that in each instance was written
                  collaboratively either in pairs or as a group of three. We discovered that working together on each
                  poem created an ebb-and-flow, push-and-pull process. Composing stand-alone collaborative haiku
                  provided continual opportunities for the organic expressions of complementary energies; complexities
                  of ideas; shifts of perspectives; and juxtapositions of personal and cultural experiences,
                  perceptions, and memories. Since this process represents intersection and unity, each poem is an
                  example of nexus: a central focal point of connection. Consequently, we call our collaborative
                  autonomous poems Nexus Haiku.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                  Following, are the poems we read at the 6th Annual Bučijada Haiku Meeting:
                </p>

                Melodic and luminous, insightfully humorous, continuously wondrous &mdash; the evocative and provocative
                haiku of <em>pilgrimage</em> lead the reader on a compelling, encompassing journey of body, mind, and
                spirit. Selected from his 15
                previous collections, including some of his earliest work and many of his most recent poems,
                <em>pilgrimage</em> is the definitive expression of Michael Dudley’s distinctive achievement.
